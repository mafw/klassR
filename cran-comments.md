## Resubmission
In this resubmission I have:
* Removed the LICENSE file

* added donttest (changed from dontrun) to examples in some of the function 
  as they were taking too long to run.

* Included protocol and <> for the website address in the description
  of the DESCRIPTION file and ensured description lines are not more
  than 80 characters.
  
* Corrected some of the wording in the description. KLASS is spelled 
  correctly and is the name of the Norwegian API system. I have added 
  single quotes to this. 
  Codelist(s) is also spelled correctly.
  
* removed one of the examples from GetName function which had a long 
  run time.
  
* added this cran-comments.md file

## Test environments
* Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
