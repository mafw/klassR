## Resubmission
In this resubmission I have:

* added dontrun to examples in the GetVersion function as they were taking
  too long to run.

* Included protocol and <> for the website address in the description
  of the DESCRIPTION file and ensured description lines are not more
  than 80 characters.
  
* Corrected some of the wording in the description. KLASS is the name
  of the Norwegian system 
  for classifications and is correctly spelt. Codelist(s) is also 
  correct.
  
* removed one of the examples from GetName function which had a long 
  run time.
  
* added this cran-comments.md file

## Test environments
* Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

## R CMD check results
There was no errors, warnings or notes when running devtools::check()

## Downstream dependencies
No reverse dependencies to check.
